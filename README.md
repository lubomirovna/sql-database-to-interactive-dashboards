## Introduction
Welcome to the Pizzeria Relational Database repository! This project aims to assist our client, Ben, in efficiently managing his new takeout and delivery pizzeria. The project involves designing and building a tailor-made bespoke relational database that will serve as the backbone for storing, managing, and analyzing the business's crucial data.

## Project Brief
Our client, Ben, is embarking on a new venture - a pizzeria that focuses exclusively on takeout and delivery services. To facilitate the seamless operation of the pizzeria and enable effective decision-making, we were tasked with creating a customized relational database. This database will be the central hub for storing a wide range of business-generated data, including customer orders, ingredients, delivery information, and more.

## Database Design
The database design is tailored to meet the unique requirements of Pizzeria. It includes the following key entities:

* Item: This table represents the various items available for order, such as pizzas and sides.
* Orders: This table captures details about customer orders, facilitating order processing and tracking.
* Ingredient: This table manages ingredient details for maintaining inventory and cost tracking.
* Recipe: This table associates ingredients with menu items, enabling efficient ingredient tracking.
* Inventory: This table tracks the available quantity of each ingredient for effective inventory management.

## Dashboard and Business Monitoring
One of the key features of this project is the ability to monitor business performance through dashboards. By leveraging the data stored in the database, you can create visualizations and reports that provide insights into sales trends, popular items, delivery efficiency, and more. Implement a dashboard solution of your choice to empower Ben with actionable business insights.
